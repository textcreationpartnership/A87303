            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHereas many malignant and rebellious Papiſts and Jeſuits, Friars, Seminary Prieſts, and other Superſtitious Orders of the Popiſh pretended Clergy, moſt diſloyally, treacherouſly, and wickedly conſpired to ſurpriſe His Majeſty's Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> His Majeſty's Principal Fort of this Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and all other Cities and Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of this Realm, and that all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> throughout the whole Kingdom, that would not join with them, ſhould be cut off; and finally, by a general Rebellion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive our late Sovereign Lord of ever Bleſſed Memory, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, of this His Ancient and Rightful Crown and Sovereignty of this Kingdom, and to poſſeſs themſelves thereof: All which was by the ſaid Conſpirators plotted and intended to be acted on the Twenty third of <hi>October,</hi> in the Year of our Lord God 1641. A Conſpiracy ſo generally inhumane, barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and cruel, as the like was never before heard of in any Age or Kingdom; and if it had taken effect in that fulneſs which was intended by the Conſpirators, it had occaſioned the utter Ruine of this whole Kingdom, and the Government there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: And however it pleaſed Almighty God, in his unſearchable Wiſdom and Juſtice, as a juſt Puniſhment, and deſerved Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto his People for their Sins, and the Sins of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to permit then and afterwards the effecting of a great part of that Deſtruction complotted by thoſe wicked Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, whereby many thouſand <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have been maſſacred, many thouſands of others of them have been affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and tormented with the moſt exquiſite Torments that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:172303:3"/>Malice could ſuggeſt; and all Mens Eſtates, as well thoſe whom they barbarouſly murdered, as all other Good Subjects, were waſted, ruined, and deſtroyed: Yet as his Divine Majeſty hath in all Ages ſhewn his Power and Mercy, in the miraculous and gracious deliverance of his Church, and in the Protection of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Kings and States; ſo even in the midſt of his Juſtice, he was graciouſly pleaſed to extend Mercy to His Majeſty and to this His Kingdom, and good Subjects therein, not only in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully diſcovering to the then Lords Juſtices, by one <hi>Owen O Connelly,</hi> a meer <hi>Iriſh-man,</hi> but trained up in the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, who out of a ſenſe of his Duty and Loyalty to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and for the preſervation of his good People, and as an Effect of that Religion he was trained up in, revealed that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous and bloody Treaſon, not many Hours before the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time for the execution thereof; but alſo in preſerving the ſaid Caſtle and City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and ſome other Cities, Towns, and Caſtles in the Kingdom, from the bloody Hands of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Conſpirators, as alſo in thereby rendring deliverance of the Lives of the ſaid Lords Juſtices and Council, and of all the <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and in the ſaid other Cities, Towns, and Caſtles preſerved, and of ſundry other <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> fallen into the Hands of thoſe rebellious Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and likewiſe in ſending us Succours out of <hi>England</hi> hither, by the Piety, Care, and Wiſdom of our late Sovereign Lord King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, whereby, with God's Bleſſing, the good Subjects of this Kingdom have hitherto continued ſafe under His mighty Protection, notwithſtanding the unexampled Rage and implacable Malice of thoſe mercileſs Rebels. Wherefore as we do moſt humbly and juſtly acknowledge God's Juſtice in our deſerved Puniſhments in thoſe Calamities, which from the Counſels and Actions of thoſe Conſpirators, and their Adherents have fallen upon us in this Kingdom in general; ſo we do in like manner acknowledge, that even in exerciſing of that his Juſtice, he remembred Mercy alſo, and magnified his Mercies to us, in thoſe great Bleſſings which we humbly confeſs to have proceeded meerly from his infinite Goodneſs and Mercy; and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:172303:3"/>therefore to his moſt holy Name we do aſcribe all Honour, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Praiſe; and to the end this unfeigned Thankfulneſs may never be forgotten, but may be had in a perpetual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, that all Ages to come may yield Praiſes to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty for the ſame, and have in Memory that joyful Day of Deliverance; Be it therefore Enacted by the King's moſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Majeſty, with the Aſſent of the Lords Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, and Commons in this preſent Parliament aſſembled, and by Authority of the ſame, That the Twenty third day of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> ſhall be kept and celebrated as an Anniverſary Holiday in this Kingdom for ever; and that all Perſons do at that Day for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear all Bodily Labour, and the Exerciſe of their Trades; and that all and ſingular Miniſters in every Cathedral and Pariſh-Church, or other uſual Place for Common-Prayer within this Realm of <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſhall always upon the Twenty third Day of <hi>October</hi> ſay Morning-Prayer, and give Thanks to Almighty God for that moſt happy and miraculous Deliverance and Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, far above the Expectations of thoſe wretched Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and that all and every Perſon and Perſons inhabiting within this Realm of <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſhall yearly upon the Twenty third of <hi>October</hi> diligently and faithfully reſort to the Pariſh-Church or Chappel accuſtomed, or to ſome uſual Church or Chappel where the ſaid Morning-Prayer, Preaching, or other Service of God ſhall be uſed, and then and there abide orderly and ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly during the time of the ſaid Prayers, Preaching, or other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God there to be uſed and miniſtred. And becauſe all and every Perſon may be put in mind of his Duty, and be then the better prepared to the ſaid Holy Service, Be it enacted by the Authority aforeſaid, That every Miniſter ſhall give warning to his Pariſhioners publickly in the Church, at Morning-Prayer, the Lords-day next before every ſuch Twenty third of <hi>October,</hi> for the due Obſervation of the ſaid Day; and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Morning-Prayer or Preaching upon every ſuch Twenty third of <hi>October,</hi> they read publickly, diſtinctly, and plainly this preſent Act.</p>

And therefore not unto us, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, O Lord, but unto thy Name be aſcribed all honour and glory, in all Churches of the Saints, throughaut all Generations. For thou, Lord, dideſt diſcover unto thy Servants the ſnares of Death; thou didſt break them, and we were delivered. Be thou ſtill our mighty Protector, and ſcatter our Enemies that delight in Blood; infatuate their Counſels, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>féeble their Strength, put Fear in their Hearts, and accompliſh this thy Mercy in our ſafety and future deliverance. And to that end, ſtrengthen the Hands of our gracious King, the Lord Lieutenant, the Nobility, and Magiſtrates of the Land, with Iudgment, Iuſtice, and Power to reſtrain ſuch workers of Iniquity, who pretend Religion and practiſe Rebellion, and devour thine Inheritance. This, Lord, we crave at thy merciful hands, together with the continuance of thy powerful Protection over our dread Sovereign, the whole Church, and theſe Realms, and the ſpéedy Converſion of all our Enemies, and that for thy dear Son's ſake, Ieſus Chriſt, our only Mediator and Advecate. <hi>Amen.</hi>

And we may as juſtly fear, that our not being made better by thy former Iudgments, thou mayeſt be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to make thy Sword ſharper, and return upon us in greater fury, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Sins are greater, more bold, more provoking: in particular, our neglect and contempt of thy ſacred Ordinances, our vain and falſe ſwearing (for which the Land mourns) our unchriſtian Vncharitableneſs, and ſhameful Intemperance, our Sacrilege, and Covetouſneſs, Hypocriſie, Slandering, and déep Security in the midſt of all our Sins and Dangers.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:172303:5"/>Theſe, together with a glorying in our Impieties, might in juſtice have brought upon us a ſudden and horrible Deſtruction. But, contrary to the method of thy Procéedings againſt others, thou haſt ſpared us, thereby woing us to return unto thée by unfeigned Repentance. Thou haſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified thy Mercy towards us, that we may magnifie thée, as we do this day, this memorable day, O Lord, for thy Patience and Long-ſuffering, notwithſtanding all our Provocations: We repent, O pardon; we return, O vouchſafe to receive us, and enable us to walk worthy of thy great paſt Deliverance, by a more ſtrict and holy future Obedience, for the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Ieſus Chriſt, our only Saviour and Redéemer. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>MOſt merciful and bountiful Lord God, ſéeing thou haſt béen graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſed to preſerve thy moſt unworthy People from total Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and daily to follow us with the Bleſſng of Peace and good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: make us therefore, O Lord, in all thankfulneſs to be obedient to thy Will in all things; to be faithful and conſtant in our Duty to the King, and to all that are in Authority under him; to be ſincere in thy Worſhip, zealous of Good works, of one Faith, and one Mind, ſtudying to be quiet, forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, even as God for Chriſts ſake hath forgiven us: ſo that when every one in his ſeveral place ſhall labour to advance the good both of Church and State, and by a through Reformation of our Lives, ſhall become a People whom thou mayeſt take delight to bleſs; then thy Iudgments which we have deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and therefore fear, may be averted, and our ſinful Souls ſaved in the day of the Lord Ieſus: Then with one heart and voice we may all praiſe thée in thy Church, and always ſing joyfully, that thy Loving-kindneſs is ever more and more towards us, and the Truth of the Lord endures for ever.
